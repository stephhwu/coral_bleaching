### Abstract

After researching for supplemental data to support our project topic, we found that the Smithsonian and the NOAA announced a new memorandum of understanding at the beginning of this year aimed at enhancing collaborative efforts to understand and conserve ocean biodiversity.

With that in mind, we were able to find data on coral bleaching in 5 jurisdictions within the Pacific Ocean sourced from NOAA along with time series data for these regions.

The map pulls data of the top bleached corals within each jurisdiction in the Pacific Ocean dataset. Hovering allows you to explore which year had the highest bleached corals and what genus that coral belonged to. Hovering over the coral images reveals coral genera that multiple regions share among their most frequently recorded bleaching observations, which may help identify potential patterns in bleaching occurrences.

The NOAA defines bleaching prevalence in their data dictionary as a measure of the proportion of the number of bleached corals to the number of all corals. This proportion of corals exhibiting thermal stress is an indicator of the status and health of coral populations.

## What is Coral Bleaching?

If users are unfamiliar with coral bleaching, we have a page that introduces the concept.

The leading cause of coral bleaching is climate change. A warming planet means a warming ocean, and a change in water temperature—as little as 2 degrees Fahrenheit—can cause coral to drive out algae.

Nutrient imbalances that stress the symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae) living within the coral make them more vulnerable to environmental stressors.

Clicking on an image allows for a deeper exploration, revealing other coral species recorded with bleaching and the prevalence percentage for each.

The row of images displays a progression from the least to the most bleaching recorded in that year. Hovering over an image reveals the bleaching prevalence and highlights changes in monitored genera over time.

## Smithsonian Contribution

The Smithsonian's contributions to coral reef research and conservation are central to this narrative. Efforts like the Healthy Reefs for Healthy People Initiative monitor coral reef health, with improvements in some regions attributed to community and government interventions. The Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute has pioneered coral cryopreservation, creating repositories containing 1 trillion frozen sperm and 3 billion larval cells from 16 species. Meanwhile, the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute explores resilient "super corals" off Panama's coast, offering hope for the future of coral reefs.
